# HOW TO SYNC CHANGES IN THE FORKED REPO WITH THE PARENT/SOURCE (e.g. `pluto`) REPO

- **E.g. This [`pluto-forked`](https://github.com/pal-stdr/pluto-forked.git) repo is a forked copy from parent [`pluto`](https://github.com/bondhugula/pluto.git) repo. Now if some latest changes comes in the `master` branch of parent `pluto`, then how can you keep sync of all branches of `pluto-forked` with the `pluto`?**

- **The same concept works, when you and your mates are working in separate branches. You can keep your branches updated with the changes your mates are doing.**


## 1. Ensure if you have the `upstream` link to the original repo

### 1.1. First check if you have the `upstream` link to the original repo, from where the forked-repo has been forked

The following means, you already have the `upstream`. Means, **you can jump for step 2. Donot need to add any thing**
```sh
git remote -v

# Returns
origin  https://github.com/pal-stdr/pluto-forked.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/pal-stdr/pluto-forked.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/bondhugula/pluto.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/bondhugula/pluto.git (push)

```

### 1.2. If you don't have the `upstream`, then you have to add it manually

```sh
git remote -v

# Returns (upstream doesn't exist)
origin  https://github.com/pal-stdr/pluto-forked.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/pal-stdr/pluto-forked.git (push)
```

So now we have to add it


```sh
# Formula - git remote add upstream <original_repository_url>
git remote add upstream https://github.com/bondhugula/pluto.git

git remote -v

# Returns
origin  https://github.com/pal-stdr/pluto-forked.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/pal-stdr/pluto-forked.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/bondhugula/pluto.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/bondhugula/pluto.git (push)
```


## 2. Fetch the changes from the upstream repository

**This will only load the latest changes from original repo. But in next steps, you have to merge it.**

```sh
git fetch upstream

# Returns

```


## 3. `checkout` the `master` branch to merge all the changes from `upstream`

- **This kind of merge works like `fast-forward` style. So you don't have a new merge commit.**
- **SOMETIMES THERE MIGHT BE CONFLICT WITH YOUR OWN CODE vs THE INCOMING CHANGES FROM THE ORIGINAL REPO. That time `fast-forward` merge will not work. You have to manage the merge conflict by hand.**

```sh
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master

# Returns
Updating 001cb37..655ca80
Fast-forward
 configure.ac | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```



## 4. Do the same for other local branches

```sh

# Fetch changes from the upstream (If you did it already, donot need to do it again)
git fetch upstream


# Checkout and merge for branch 'feature1'
git checkout feature1
git merge upstream/master

# Checkout and merge for branch 'feature2'
git checkout feature2
git merge upstream/master

# Checkout and merge for branch 'bugfix1'
git checkout bugfix1
git merge upstream/master
```
